# Starbucks-customer-segmentation
# Project Overview :
The motivation behind this project is to propose a solution that helps the company in forming a better understanding of its customers base. In this project, an unsupervised learning technique will be used to segment customers and measure how each segment behave during different periods of the test. In particular, K-Means clustering will be used. The provided dataset of courses will go through different phases at first before being ready for modeling. Starting with cleaning and ending with the final dataset grouped by customer profiles with their data aggreated.

Here's a high-level overview of the workflow followed in this project:

- Define the problem in-hands and measurement criterias.
- Explore, understand, and clean the provided datasets.
- Prepare final dataset grouped by customers.
- Transform final dataset appropriately before fitting model.
- Fit model on final dataset and predict cluster labels.
- Explore distributions among formed clusters.
- Discuss outcomes and make recommendations.
